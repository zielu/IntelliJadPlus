<div style="margin-bottom:5px; margin-top:5px;">
    The memory VFS manager allows you to view and remove decompiled files from memory.  It's accessible through the
    Tools/IntelliJad menu.
</div>

</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:5px; margin-top:5px;">
    Files can be viewed by expanding the tree, and selected by using the checkbox in each tree node.  The checkbox
    selection is hierarchical, so all nodes below the selected node are also selected/deselected depending on the state
    of the current checkbox.
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:5px; margin-top:5px;">
    The file size readout gives two values - the first shows the total size in bytes of the content of all files.  The
    second gives the size in bytes of all selected files.  Note this only reflects the content of the files - it does
    not calculate the overall object size required to support the memory VFS.
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:5px; margin-top:5px;">
    <div class="sectionheader">Using the manager</div>
    The manager has the following controls, situated to the left of the tree.
    <table cellpadding="1" border="1">
        <tr>
            <td>Expand</td>
            <td>If a node is selected, expand it.  If nothing is selected, expand the entire tree.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Collapse</td>
            <td>If a node is selected, collapse it.  If nothing is selected, collapse the entire tree.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Delete</td>
            <td>Delete all selected files from the memory VFS.  This only affects decompiled sources, it will not
                affect classes in any way.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Attach IntelliJad memory VFS as source root</td>
            <td>
                Manually attaches the memory VFS to the project SDK's source roots.  This operation occurs automatically
                on decompilation, but this option allows you to attach it if you have removed it, either using the
                "Remove IntelliJad memory VFS from source root" option or via the JDK manager.  If the memory VFS is
                already attached to the project SDK, this option will be disabled.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Remove IntelliJad memory VFS from source root</td>
            <td>
                Removes the memory VFS from the project SDK's source roots.  This is the same as manually removing the
                source root using the JDK manager.  If the memory VFS is not attached to the project SDK, this option
                will be disabled.
            </td>
        </tr>
